# TripScout - Bangkit Capstone Project

# Introduction
Trip Scout is a tour guide application on a local scale, in this case, the city of Semarang. Semarang has many tourist destinations such as nature tourism, culinary tourism, cultural tourism, and other types of tourism. This application will help tourists visiting Semarang to get recommendations, explanations, and things they need to know about the tours they visit.

One of the problems faced by tourists when traveling in Semarang is the lack of information about tourist sites so they need a tour guide to help them, which requires additional costs. This application is expected to be a substitute for tour guides in guiding tourists visiting the city of Semarang.

Our team created this project because we realized that there is still a lack of efficient and interactive tourism applications that can provide a personalized and comprehensive experience to users. Therefore, we decided to create an application that can use machine learning to provide recommendations and descriptions of tourist attractions to users. Our team aims to provide users with a unique and personalized experience that can help them explore and discover new places more efficiently and interestingly.
